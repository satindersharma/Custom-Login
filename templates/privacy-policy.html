    <strong>We protect your privacy.</strong><br />
    Any information you give us stays with us. We do not rent, sell, lend, or
    otherwise distribute your personal information to anyone for any reason.
    This includes your contact information, as well as specific order
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>We limit data access to those who need to know.</strong><br />
    Within our organization, your personal data is accessible to only a limited
    number of employees with special access privileges. Although we may, from
    time to time, compile general demographic information based on your order,
    this information is shared within our organization only and has no
    identifiable personal data associated with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Information Collected</strong><br />
    To enable you to place an order on our site, we need to have the following
    basic information about you: Your First Name, Your Last Name, and Your
    Address, City, Zip code, State, Country, Phone Number and Contact E-mail
    address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from this, our systems gather certain details about your computerâ€™s
    internet connection like your IP address when you visit our site. Your IP
    address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver
    our web pages to you upon request, to customize our site as per your

    geographic locations from where our visitors come.

    visitors, and anyone not in our organization to use any information

  <p>
    <strong>Information Sharing</strong><br />
    Probably this is the most important question in your mind as to with whom do
    we share your information? The answer to this question is that we do not
    rent, sell, barter, or give away your information to anyone. To some extent,
    information has to be passed on to the courier companies, credit card
    processing companies, vendors, etc. to enable them to perform their
    functions related to your order fulfilment. Apart from this normal business
    requirement, information may also be needed to be shared with law
    authorities, for fraud detection, and for the safety of our site, employees,
    management, users, members and other affiliates associated with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Information Usage</strong><br />
    The most important usage of the information collected from you is your email
    which is used to inform you that your order has been confirmed/executed.
    Your email is also used to inform you for your customer service related
    queries and for any newsletters sent. All other information collected is
    confidentially stored and will not be disclosed unless needed as per the
    requirement of the law authorities or in case of any disputes.
